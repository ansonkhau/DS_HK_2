##Issue
One of the biggest issue when booking a flight is not knowing what the actual experience will be like.  Most of the time, travellers are focused on the price of the ticket with little knowledge on the quality of the flight such as delays and frequency of calculations, quality of service and food.  If a traveller knows that the flight he/she is about to book has a high chance of being delayed because of tight scheduling or busy departure time, he/she may think twice before booking that flight.

##Objective 
The objective of this project is to develop an application to analyse and predict the quality of the flight beginning from probability of delays to the quality of service as extracted from past reviews.  

##Scope
The scope of this project will be limited to domestic flights in the United States.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a comprehensive dataset of all US domestic flights that can be obtained easily.  The main focus will be the delay prediction algorithm, followed by the quality of flights from extraction of reviews for the particular carrier.  This scope will allow the concentration of developing the prediction algorithm rather than spending time finding and cleaning data.  

##Possible Model Selection
Predicting flight delays is a classification problem.  Initially the algorithm will take advantage of tree algorithm followed by further sophisticated algorithms where necessary.  Because not all the models have been introduced yet, the final model selection has not been made yet.  Suggestions would be greatly appreciated! 

The model for reviews will probably be Naivie Bayes since is is a classification problem focusing on words.
