## Objective/Abstract 
The authors in this paper discusses the often ineffective use of data within organisations causing a low return for the time and effort spent of acquiring big data.  In many instances, the authors demonstrated that good use of little data may be more effective.  

The main hypothesis of this paper is that the biggest reason why investments in big data fail to pay off is that most companies do not good a good job with the information they already have.  They do not know how to manage it, analyse it in ways that enhance their understanding and then make changes in response to the new insights.  

This hypothesis brings out a point that many business executives often overlook the process of effectively utilising big data and in many times drowned into the hype of how large investments in acquiring big data can optimise their business instantaneously like a magic wind.  As such, this perspective of learning how to effectively use data already existent in a business can be more advantages than blindly invest to acquire more data that the business can handle to its advantage.  

##Style 

The audience of this paper is business executives who has little to no technical knowledge on data science.  The authors in this paper through real business examples explores how from a business perspective data can be used effectively within the organisation.  

To support their hypothesis, the authors brought out examples from companies worldwide such as Seven-Eleven Japan, Aetna and Foxtel, Australia's largest provider of paid-TV.


##Methods 

This paper begins by outlining the research methodologies used for the study.  

This is then followed by examples of companies who are successful in utilising 'small data'.  For example, to demonstrate the empowerment of data use for employees, the authors demonstrated an example for Seven-Eleven Japan where store clerks are sent daily sales reports and supplementary information such as weather forecasts in order to empower them to make better decisions of daily store replenishments.  

Having demonstrated effective use of big data, the authors explains the management techniques behind the use of big data to better drive its effectiveness.  These include Agree on a Single Source of Truth, Use Scorecards, Explicitly Manage Your Business Rules, and Use Coaching to Improve Performance.  

By giving examples of successful cases and then explaining the management principles, the authors successfully brought out an overlooked point amongst the hype of big data.  It is not only the use of big data and investment in acquiring the big data that helps a business perform better.  

##Conclusion 
The management principles behind the use of big data is as important in having the sophisticated mechanisms in obtaining it.  The authors effectively brought across this main point.  It may be helpful however, if there were data or statistics behind the research that the authors can present as well.  This would appeal to more data savvy managers who may want to look into more details quantitatively.   As an article targeted towards business executives, this will help them shed light onto how they should manage and empower their employees into better use of data on hand.
